<p>Instead of using stock, we use leftover broth soup in this recipe to cook the rice. To cook for more serving, simply prepare more soup or use plain water (which requires more seasoning with broth mix). It is up to your judgement to decide which soup is appropriate to cook with rice.</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Chop the onion and garlic. Heat up the leftover soup if necessary; add water and seasoning if there is not enough water (usually you will need thrice the amount of water for every one part of rice). Also, the soup we are talking here is the kind of liquid soup, not the foamy one. For the rice, it could be any typical white grain rice.</p>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat up a pan with oil in medium high heat, then fry and caramelize the onion and garlic until slightly golden. Do not fry until fully golden as we will continue fry the onion and garlic for a while in the next step.</li>
    <li>Add the rice and fry it along with the onion and garlic for about 1 minute to introduce the caramel and oil into the rice. Fry until the onion and garlic is completely golden.</li>
    <li>Add soup broth into the pan until it wet all of the grain. Stir the rice around to let it absorb all of the water before adding more broth. Slowly add water, then stir to let the water absorb into the grain before adding more. Repeat this step until the rice is cooked through.</li>
    <li>Season the risotto before taking off the heat.</li>
    <li>Serve it along with the remaining solid from the soup.</li>
